If you don‚Äôt have enough memory available, your computer will get very slow because the OS will start swapping. If you have to use a machine without that much memory available, you can instead implement in a streaming approach by using the `stream_contexts()` generator function to access the data; this lets you iterate through the data from disk, one vector at a time, without putting everything into memory. You can see its use in the loading function. (You could also alternatively use a key-value or other type of database, but that‚Äôs too much work for this assignment.)"
