One way to explain this idea: if you take \"king\", get rid of its attributes/contexts it shares with \"man\", and add in the attributes/contexts of \"woman\", hopefully you'll get to a point in the space that has king-like attributes but the \"man\" ones replaced with \"woman\" ones.\n",

If the output makes sense, explain why we can capture such relation between words using an unsupervised algorithm. Where does the information come from? On the other hand, if the output does not make sense, propose an explanation why the algorithm fails on this case.\n",
